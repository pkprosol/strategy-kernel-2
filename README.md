# Strategy Kernel

Personal data reactor — a unified life records layer where assessments, goals, habits, health, journal entries, finances, relationships, and beliefs live in a standardized format. Claude and productivity apps can read/write via MCP.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run dev
```

## MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server && npm install && npm run build
```

Add to Claude Desktop config — see `/settings` in the app for config snippet.
